CDS for tonight is out, and some interesting bits in there

The intensity of Russian airstrikes south of Bakhmut (mainly Su-25 and Ka-52) increased significantly;


The Russian command in the Bakhmut direction formed an artillery group consisting of the 305th artillery brigade, 27th, 1065th, 1182nd artillery regiments of the territorial troops, up to six separate divisions, which is clearly excessive and requires separate analysis;
 We have all of those artillery folk there, but don't really understand what it means. 

With an unexpected maneuver, units of the “Tavriya” operational grouping entered the northern part of Urozhaine, went to the northern outskirts of Staromayorske and advanced to Kerminchyk, bypassing Novodonetske;
 eh, believe it when I see it

Advanced units of Ukrainian Defense Forces entered the city of Bakhmut, knocking out the positions of the 4th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 2nd Russian Army Corps, advanced beyond the Yubileyna street simultaneously in several quarters;
 Likewise, re-entering the city here
Units of the 72nd separate motorized rifle brigade of the 3rd Russian Army Corps completely retreated to Klishchiivka and are already forced to fight hold the village;
 Makes sense
The 22nd separate mechanized brigade and 80th separate airborne assault brigade of the Ukrainian Defense Forces have cleared the forest strips west of Klishchiivka and advance further, units of the 28th separate mechanized brigade and 3rd separate assault brigade pushed back units of the Russian 83rd separate airborne assault brigade and approached Klishchiivka from the west and southwest.
 83rd airborne moved from Kherson to Bakhmut
The 249th motorized battalion of the Federal Service of the National Guard Troops of RF  "Akhmat-Yug (South)" is being moved from Kopani to the same village. It has not yet taken part in battles and has moved even deeper to the rear.
 shocked I tell thee
Positions in Kopani were occupied by the remnants of the 291st motorized rifle regiment, the "Tsarskie Volki (Tsar’s wolves)" PMC detachment (formed by Roscosmos) and the 11th BARS detachment.
